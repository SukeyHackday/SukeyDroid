[SukeyDroid](http://www.sukey.org) is a port of our popular web app that is designed to keep people safe, mobile and informed during demonstrations. We crowdsource updates from twitter and other online and offline sources in order to provide our users with a timely overview of what is going on at a demonstration. We also provide our users with a map view, a compass view and the ability to send us reports and updates through the app itself.
